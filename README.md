# MTGO_DEK_UPDATER
Updates MTGO .dek netdeck files to use card arts/sets you own


Don't you hate when you download an MTGO .dek file from mtggoldfish that contains versions of cards not in your library? This is a hassle because you have to remove the cards you don't own from your deck, and then search for and manually add the card versions you DO own back in to your deck.


Well, this tool imports a .dek file of your MTGO collection and creates a master card library of card versions you own. Once you have imported your MTGO collection, you can use this information to update netdeck .dek files you downloaded to use only the CardIDs of card versions you actually own!


To use:
1. Export a .dek file of your entire MTGO collection
2. Click the "IMPORT COLLECTION .DEK" button and select the file you created in step #1
3. Obtain a .dek file from mtggoldfish or some other source of MTGO decklists
4. Click the "IMPORT AND PARSE .DEK FILE" button, navigate to the file you obtained in step #3 and press okay
5. The program will tell you where it has exported the updated .dek file which contains only card versions you own
6. Import this newly created .dek file into MTGO and enjoy saving some of your valuable time
